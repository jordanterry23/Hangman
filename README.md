# Hangman
A simple hangman game made in python.

This game takes words that are entered into the words.txt file, line byt line, and chooses one at random.

The player can then try to solve the puzzle by entering one letter at a time, or by entering what they think is the solution to the puzzle. 

However, each mistake causes the hangman to appear. If the player makes 7 mistakes, it's game over.
